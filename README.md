## AIOS
We are 5 students from IUST university in Iran and we're studying mathematics and applications. we have signed up for an AI competition where we have to present a model as our final project. Here, we will share the code we used for the models that we made. 
### GOALS
We should create a deep learning model that learns from a large amount of eeg data, labeled into five groups. These groups represent the different states of sleep of the individuals whose brainwaves are being studied. For instance, 50,000 samples correspond to people who are awake.
The deep learning model will identify patterns and learn from this dataset. Subsequently, it will be able to determine whether a given sample corresponds to the awake state or different levels of sleep. The final output will serve as a classifier that the model uses for classification.
