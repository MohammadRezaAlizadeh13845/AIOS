## AIOS
We are a group of five students from IUST University in Iran, specializing in mathematics and its applications. This repository is part of our submission for an AI competition, where we aim to develop and present a deep learning model as our final project. Here, we will share the code and resources used to create our models.
### GOALS
Our objective is to design a deep learning model capable of analyzing a large EEG dataset labeled into five categories. These categories represent various sleep states of individuals based on their brainwave activity. For example, 50,000 samples in the dataset correspond to individuals in the awake state.

The deep learning model will learn patterns from the dataset, enabling it to classify EEG samples into the appropriate sleep states, including awake and different sleep levels. The final output will serve as a classifier to perform accurate sleep state identification.
